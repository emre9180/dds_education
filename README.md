# Mini-DDS Library

A minimal Data Distribution Service (DDS) library for learning and experimenting with C++ concurrency, communication, and system-level programming concepts.

## Project Goals
- Deepen understanding of C++ concurrency, threading, and synchronization
- Explore inter-process communication (IPC) and networking
- Implement serialization and deserialization
- Learn about real-time and low-level system programming
- Apply design patterns and architectural best practices
- Practice performance profiling, testing, and debugging

## Modules
- **Concurrency & Threading**: Thread pools, mutexes, atomics
- **IPC & Communication**: TCP/UDP sockets, shared memory
- **Serialization & Data**: Custom and optional 3rd-party serialization
- **Realtime Concepts**: QoS, deadlines, latency
- **Low-Level System**: Memory management, allocators
- **Design Patterns & Architecture**: Pub-Sub, Observer, Factory, Singleton
- **Performance & Profiling**: Benchmarks, timers
- **Build System & Tooling**: CMake, Conan/vcpkg
- **Testing & Debugging**: Unit/integration tests, sanitizers
- **Error Handling**: Exception safety, error codes
- **Async/Event Systems**: Event loops, async callbacks

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Build with CMake
3. Run tests and examples
